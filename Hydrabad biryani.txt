Here's a recipe for Hyderabad Chicken Biryani:

Ingredients:

2 cups Basmati rice
500 grams chicken, cut into pieces
2 onions, thinly sliced
2 tomatoes, chopped
2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste
1 cup plain yogurt
2 teaspoons Biryani masala powder
1 teaspoon red chili powder
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder
1/4 cup chopped mint leaves
1/4 cup chopped coriander leaves
4 cups water
4 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil
Salt to taste
For the marinade:

1/2 cup plain yogurt
2 teaspoons red chili powder
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 tablespoon lemon juice
Salt to taste
For the garnish:

Fried onions
Chopped mint leaves
Chopped coriander leaves
Saffron strands soaked in warm milk (optional)
Instructions:

Wash the basmati rice under running water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.

In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken pieces with all the marinade ingredients. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 1 hour or overnight in the refrigerator for better flavor.

In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions and set them aside for garnishing.

Add the ginger-garlic paste to the remaining onions in the pot and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.

Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy.

Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook for about 5 minutes until the chicken is browned.

In a separate pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling water along with salt. Cook the rice until it is 70% cooked (it should still have a slight bite to it). Drain the rice and set it aside.

Add the cooked rice to the pot with the chicken, spreading it evenly over the chicken. Do not mix.

In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, biryani masala powder, red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, and garam masala powder. Pour this mixture evenly over the rice.

Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil over the rice.

Sprinkle the chopped mint leaves and coriander leaves over the rice. Also, add a few fried onions on top.

Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the flavors have melded together.

Once cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it rest for 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to further develop.

Garnish the biryani with fried onions, chopped mint leaves, and chopped coriander leaves. You can also add saffron strands soaked in warm milk for an enhanced aroma and flavor.

Serve the Hyderabad Chicken Biryani hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or any side dish of your choice.

Enjoy your delicious Hyderabad Chicken Biryani!
